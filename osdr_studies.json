    "title": "Re-Adaption on Earth after Spaceflights Affects the Mouse Liver Proteome",
    "description": "Harsh environmental conditions including microgravity and radiation during prolonged spaceflights are known to alter hepatic metabolism. Our studies have focused on the analysis of possible changes in metabolic pathways in livers of mice which experienced 30 days of spaceflight with and without an additional re-adaption period of 7 days compared to control mice on Earth. Utilizing shotgun mass spectrometry and label-free quantification, we performed proteomic profiling to investigate mice livers from the spaceflight project “Bion-M 1”. No significant alterations in protein levels were observed between control mice liver and spaceflight mice which is possibly caused by insufficient fold change detection combined with high variances within the groups. In contrast, our results show that more than a third of the quantified protein levels are altered comparing the liver proteome of mice with and without re-adaption time after their spaceflight. Proteins related to amino acid metabolism showed higher levels after re-adaption, which may indicate higher rates of gluconeogenesis. Members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathway reconstitute their level after 7 days due to a decrease in fold change, which indicates decreased signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover, bile acid secretion regenerates on Earth due to reconstitution of related transmembrane proteins and elevated levels of the drug-metabolising enzymes belonging to the CYP superfamily decrease 7 days after the spaceflight. Thus, our study demonstrates reconstitution of pharmacological response and early signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease recover within 7 days, whereas glucose uptake should be monitored due to alterations in gluconeogenesis.",

Further analysis was performed with a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Q ExactiveTM HF Hybrid Quadrupole-OrbitrapTM Mass spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockwell, IL, USA). Mass spectra were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 (MS) and 15,000 (MS/MS) in a m/z range of 400−1500 (MS) and 200–2000 (MS/MS). An isolation threshold of 100,000 counts was determined for precursor’s selection and up to top 25 precursors were chosen for fragmentation with high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at 25 NCE and 100 ms accumulation time. Precursors with a charged state of +1 were rejected and all measured precursors were excluded from measurement for 20 s. At least three technical runs were measured for each sample.\n\nSeveral technical replicates of our biological replicates were measured and the mass spectrometer did not perform well on all of the technical replicates (e.g. voltage issues/lack of ionization spray during measurement). Therefore, we excluded some technical replicates leading to an unequal number of technical replicates."

A maximum mass deviation of 4.5 ppm was allowed for precursor’s identification and 20 ppm were set as match tolerance for fragment identification (acquisition in Orbitrap). Up to two missed cleavages were allowed for trypsin digestion. The software option “Match between runs” was enabled and features within a time window of 0.7 min were used to match between runs. The false discovery rates (FDR) for peptide and protein identifications were set to 1%. Only unique peptides were used for label-free quantification (LFQ) according to the method described by Cox et al.\n\nRaw files were converted into a .mzML file format using ProteoWizard 3.0.10875."

To avoid violent behavior mice were trained before the flight and ground control experiment to form the stable groups of three mice each. Animals were adapted to paste diet. Stable cohorts of three mice were housed in each habitat during spaceflight and ground control experiment. During spaceflight the mice were fed with paste-like food with 76–78% water content developed at IBMP RAS. The mice were kept in a natural light-dark cycle (12 h light and 12 h dark). In our experiment, we compared liver proteomes of the mice which passed 30 days (from 19 April 2013 to 19 May 2013) in a biosatellite in space and sampled 13–25 h after landing (flight group) with mice of the same spaceflight sampled seven days after landing (post-flight group). Mice held in a biosatellite on Earth in the similar cage from 26 July 2013 to 26 August 2013 under the corresponding housing and climate conditions (temperature, humidity, and atmosphere gas composition) served as control group. The environmental conditions as well as food delivery were continuously recorded during spaceflight."

    "description": "To understand the molecular mechanisms affected by spaceflight, it is essential to achieve high quality sample preservation on-orbit for downstream gene expression analysis. However, sample preservation protocols must also be compatible with available equipment and crew time. NASA's Rodent Research (RR) missions have used various methods for euthanasia, carcass preservation, and tissue preservation. This study extends the sample preservation study performed by GeneLab in GLDS-49 which examined conditions used for the RR-1 mission to include conditions used for multiple RR missions and is designed to help determine factors which may confound data analysis. To determine whether these various factors affect changes in gene expression, this ground-based study generated gene expression profiles measured by RNAseq from the livers of 20-21 week-old female C57BL/6J mice. Multiple, interacting factors were investigated: 1) To understand how euthanasia protocols affect gene expression when mouse carcasses are slow frozen, mice were euthanized by either euthasol injection, ketamine/xylazine injection, or CO2 inhalation, and carcasses slow frozen on dry-ice mimicking carcass preservation in the MELFI on the ISS. Carcasses were thawed and RNA extracted from livers; 2) To understand how carcass preservation protocols affect gene expression, mice were euthanized with euthasol and carcasses preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, slow freezing on dry ice, or immersion in RNAlater following three-way segmentation. Carcasses were thawed and RNA extracted from livers; 3) To understand how tissue preservation protocols affect gene expression, mice were euthanized with euthasol and livers dissected and processed immediately, or preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, slow freezing on dry ice, or immersion in RNAlater. Liver samples that were processed immediately were homogenized in RLT buffer and then either immediately further processed for RNA extraction or were stored for 70 days at -80C post-homogenization in sample RLT buffer prior to RNA extraction.",

The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to less than2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. TMT isobaric label reagent lot number RD231319 (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/90110). The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM and 400 mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50 mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2 % formic acid, 2 % acetonitrile, 97.8 % water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.  Samples were divided in two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Both runs also include one pooled channel of all the samples except for B7 due to insufficient amount."

        "description": "The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped.

    "description": "Proper interpretation of RNA sequencing data requires an understanding of assay sensitivity and sources of variability. To this end, the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) developed a standard set of 92 poly-adenylated RNA transcripts that are orthogonal to mammalian RNA that can be added to RNA extracts before library generation and sequencing. The presence of these RNA standards at known ratios improves interpretation of RNA sequencing datasets. To test the utility of the ERCC RNA controls, total RNA extracted from mouse livers from the Rodent Research 1 (flight, ground control, basal control and vivarium control groups) and Rodent Research 3 (flight, ground control and basal control groups) missions were sequenced with and without the ERCC control RNA (RR-3 liver samples without ERCC control have been sequenced previously and the dataset is released in the GLDS-137). To allow comparison within and between groups, ERCC Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added to half of the samples from each group, respectively.",

These liver samples were collected and processed as described in GLDS-25 (<a href=\"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-25).\" target=\"_\" >https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-25).</a> This protocol is repeated here. On July 8, 2011, age- and weight-matched female C57BL/6CR mice (n=15/group) were placed into three Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 2 groups of 5 per AEM separated by a wire mesh) and flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13 days. There were two sets of ground controls housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC. Due to the nature of the NASA BSP program, we did not receive tissues from all mice for all assays. Ground AEM control mice were placed into the same hardware used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature and CO2 levels were matched as closely as possible based on 48-hour delayed telemetry data. Conditions were controlled for temperature, humidity, and a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle; food (food bars developed by NASA Ames) and water was provided ad libitum. Vivarium control mice were housed in standard shoebox cages and fed standard rodent chow. Vivarium mice were used to normalize cell counts, minimizing day-to-day variability. Mice were euthanized and dissected within 3-5 hours of landing. As part of the primary science, all mice underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry (Piximus, Inc., Fitchburg, WI) immediately prior to anesthesia and euthanization. Mice were anesthetized with 3-5% isoflurane and euthanized with 100% CO2 and exsanguination. Livers were collected within 3-4 hours of landing, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80C freezer."

        "description": "RNA was extracted from liver tissue using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT and kept on ice until use. Approximately 20 mg of frozen liver tissue was immediately placed in 800 µL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 21,300 g to remove cell debris. Following the manufacturer’s protocol, RNA was isolated and purified from the supernatant. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNase-free H2O. RNA concentration was measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).\n\n"

        "name": "radiation dosimetry",
        "description": "The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at <a href=\"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/environmental/radiation/sts/\n\nThe\" target=\"_\" >https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/environmental/radiation/sts/\n\nThe</a> ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure."

Raw RSEM count data generate with GL-DPPD-7101-A, were re-processed through normalization and DGE analysis as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (<a href=\"https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md\" target=\"_\" >https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md</a>). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (<a href=\"https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip\" target=\"_\" >https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip</a>), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher ([<a href=\"https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip\" target=\"_\" >https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip</a>]). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only group B ERCC genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb, PANTHER.db, and org.Mm.eg.db. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (<a href=\"https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md\" target=\"_\" >https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md</a>), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).
